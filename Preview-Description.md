In this preview, I am showing the jeans pocket and attempting to make the lottery ticket poke out of the back pocket of the jeans.
This is in an attempt to show that if you do not appreciate, try to work on or better your skills, or use the skills that you have developed or were born with, you have the potential to lose them.
The lottery ticket is in an attempt to show the concept of "winning", in the metaphor "Do not leave a winning lottery ticket in your back pocket". 
The text is in an attempt to further develop this idea - although I have had issues making the lottery ticket flow with the picture and making the letters stand out. Also, I feel that I need more blank space for this image, as it looks rather cluttered.
