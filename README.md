# Project 2: Visual Rhetorical Collage

The goal of this assignment was to create a visual rhetoric that makes an argument. In my visual rhetoric, I am making the argument or analogy "Don't leave a winning lottery ticket in your back pocket", meaning that if you have skills and abilities, you should keep working on them and be grateful for these redeeming qualities. In my visual rhetoric, I ask the reader, "Would you leave a winning lottery ticket in your back pocket?", if you wouldn't, then why would you not appreciate the skills and abilities that you have, and use them to your advantage. Just like in a performance, you would not want to throw away all that hard work, you would want to show it off. Therefore, I am showing the winning lottery ticket falling out of a rip in the person's back pocket, further enhancing the metaphor or analogy. I am also making the argument that the reader themselves are important, that working on their own skills and abilities is not selfish, and they should put themselves first in order to better themselves, and shoud not let other people distract them from their goals.
